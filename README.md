<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>The following data cleaning steps were observed:</p>

   <li>The filter feature was applied in other to easily observe the entries per field. </li>
   <li>Duplicates were removed.</li>
   <li>The fine and replace feature of excel was used to replace “M” and “S” to “Married” and “Single” respectively in the Marital Status field. The same was done to “M” and “F” in the gender field which was changed to “Male” and “Female” respectively. </li>
